This file contain a ships game with asteroids! you better destroy them all or be destroyed by them!
==================
=  Description:  =
==================
This file make an asteroids game. wih specific made spaceship you will be able to play this game. the program, contains lots of functions for each object.
which brings us to the thinking behind making 4 classes for this game. ship/asteroid/torpedos/screen. 
each has it own unique variables and shared functions. 
and also get and set functions where is necessary.

=  Questions     =
==================
Three decisions that we had during coding:
1.whether to use deepcopy in some places or not. we found that using deepcopy will change the id number which means the register 
function wont find it. and after reading a bit about this function, register look into real object list and check each time their id!
 
2.we wondered about the move class. about making move for each class or just making one shared function on main function(game_loop). 
first we started with making for each and later on we combined all into one function that rules them all! :)

3.its not a decision but more like a new thinking that we learnt.
about while loops and how dynamic games work. we knew this kind of things exist but we didnt knew how they are made.
