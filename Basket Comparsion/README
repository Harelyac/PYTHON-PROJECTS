=  Description:  = 
==================
With this exercise we created a tool that alows the user to make
a comparsion of a wanted shopping list in three different stores.
The program supplies an information about each store- which one is
the cheapest and which one is lack of some items. In addition, the user
can save his basket list into a outer file or upload a one of his own
and make a comparsion in the wanted stores.
