I discussed the exercise with: none.

====================================
=  README for ex6: ex6.py		
====================================
This file, makes a mosaic image out of an original image. which means that it imitate the colors of 
the original image with same r,g,b pixel ratio of pieces from a large arsenal of choices. 
at the end the result is quite beautiful.
==================
=  Description:  =
==================

1.compare_pixel:
This function calculate the RGB ratio difference between two given pixels. 
and return the difference according to specific calculation.

2.compare:
This function compare two images in a wider scale of comparison. 
which means it will compare all pixels inside each image with the 
correspond pixel on the other image. 

3.get_piece:
This function gets a piece out of an image(just copying it of course) 
for further uses of other functions - Comparing with chosen tile to switch with it.

4.set_piece:
This function make a good use of the chosen image that was chosen with care 
and eventually put it inside the image. which means it will switch 
the original image part with the new one(tile)

5.average:
This function checks the average RGB count of all pixels in the image.

6.preprocess_tiles:
This function check all the average RGB count of tiles in a list.

7.get_best_tiles:
This function check the best tiles out of the list of tiles with given averages RGB 
count after checking the difference of a tile from the obj image.

8.choose_tile:
This function choose the best tile! the one and only tile that will be the 
chosen one to switch the original image part.

9.make_mosaic:
The main and root of all the project. this functions call all the rest of 
functions and make a good use of them all. 1 step by another.

10.main:
This functions make first initializations before starting all the project. 
those necesssary to make sure everythings will word just ok.
