MakeFile
VMtranslator 

basic idea - creating a bytecode translator which recieve byte/vm code and translate it into assembly code

Parser.py - a python file that includs the main class and also the parsering process in which we deal with reading the commands.
CodeWriter.py - this is part of the program where we check the divided element from the vm file which was given from the parser and then translate them to Assembly code.

further details:
described in the files themselfs. it was quite fun working along again with assembly code. we look forward to do the next python project.f
seems like that now at project 8 we used more the vmEmulator. at first i did not find at necessary crucial need of using it. 
the project was really fun and educational indeed. looking forward for next assignments.
