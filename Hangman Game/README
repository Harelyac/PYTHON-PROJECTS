I discussed the exercise with: none.

====================================
=  README for ex4: hangman.py		
====================================
This file via using the hangman_helper.py file makes the famous hangman game alive.
the hangman game is a classical game in which you are given a word to guess with given pattern.
you have few guesses an available hint mechanisem built in. at the same time that you try to guess the word
if you fail you are one step into making the full hangman pivot alive. when hangman picture is fully complete its indicate 
that you failed and you should play again.
==================
=  Description:  =
==================

1.update_word_pattern:
This function get the right guessed word and pattern and change the pattern accordingly.

2.filter_word_list:
This function is part of the biggest "hint" mechanisem. the part that this function play is that 
it gets all the words in the words file and then sort them with special conditions. and then return that list

3.letter_to_index & index_to_letter:
This two functions serve the same result but on the opposite way around. 
basically each one of them return the index/char with given char/index in the alpabetical order.

4.choose_letter:
This function check the maximal shows of a char with given words list

5.run_single_game:
this function run iteration of a game one at a time.

6.main:
this is the main bone of the file. its the main functions that control all the others.

7.*at the end of the file there is 2 codes lines that starts the gui of pill modules and close it accordingly

=  Questions     =
==================
Answer to questions that has been asked in the file:
with changing language to hebrew, we will have to change the maximal_chars listin choose_letter function. to be at the same size of number of letter in the hebrew language,
in addition the ascci decimal value of "alef" letter in the extended character set of the ascii table depend on using the code page 862 of for hebrew letters.
